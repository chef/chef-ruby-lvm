# chef-ruby-lvm

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/chef-ruby-lvm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/chef-ruby-lvm)

This is a fork of the chef-ruby-lvm gem found at <https://github.com/gregsymons/di-ruby-lvm>. The primary difference from upstream is that it depends on chef-ruby-lvm-attrib instead of di-ruby-lvm-attrib. It was in turn forked from ruby-lvm. This adds support for lvm version 2.02.66(2) and later.

This is a wrapper for the LVM2 administration utility, lvm. Its primary function is to convert physical volumes, logical volumes and volume groups into easy-to-use ruby objects. It also provides a simple wrapper for typical create/delete/etc operations.

Due to a lack of LVM2 api this is a best effort attempt at ruby integration but subject to complete replacement in the future.

## Features and Issues

- Exposes all possible data from the lvs/vgs/pvs commands. Data is grouped sensibly (I hope).
- Doesn't nicely wrap creation/deletion/etc operations, they must be created by hand and passed as raw commands.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'lvm'

LVM::LVM.new(command: '/usr/bin/sudo /sbin/lvm') do |lvm|
  puts "lvm version: #{lvm.version}\n"

  lvm.volume_groups.each do |vg|
    puts "vg: #{vg.name}"
  end
end
```

## Requirements

- chef-ruby-lvm-attrib
- popen4

## Installation

```bash
sudo gem install chef-ruby-lvm
```
